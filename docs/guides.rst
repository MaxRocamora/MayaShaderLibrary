Getting Started
---------------

Once the maya plugin is loaded, you should see a new menu called *'Arcane Tools'* on the maya menu bar
Under menus 'Arcane Tools' > 'Lighting & Shading' > 'Arcane Shader Library' you can start the script.

Once you load the tool you should see the interface.

How to use
----------

The MayaShaderLibrary works by creating Categories, inside each category you will save/load your shaders.
Categorys will be created but not displayed until you 'pin' them to the interface, so you can have lots of categories
but only the the ones your are currently in use.
